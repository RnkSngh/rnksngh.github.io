Programming in weird programming languages.

Uiua is an array programming langu.

The weirdest thing about this is that.
Arrays are perhaps the most widely used data structure. It's interesting to.

It was interesting working on this
I kind of had a similar - though that was applied to things not in programming; and science and engineering and academic research. Matricies are very easily used in data science (e.g. to represent whatever); simulating some type of system or measurement in your model. But they aren't

- What is uiua
  - on some level, programming is kind of all? It all compiles down into and serialized into bytes, so hidden between many many layers of abstraction is what it is?
- Quirks - the stack. Weird that stacks are usually
