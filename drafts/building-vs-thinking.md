Being a developer is interesting because you both have to think and do at the same time.

Working hard and thinking are both pretty core values in tech.This balance is very hard to strike. If you do too much without reflecting on what and why you are doing it, you might miss out on optimizations you can make, and lose touch with the general vision of why you're doing is important. - _ ways to work smarter, not harder_. And yet, if you reflect too much, you become prone to analysis paralisis, and also the risk of _just not getting much done_. I feel like in general this is a life skill, but this is so much more pronounced in software engineering, since you have to be proficient at both to be successful. I've always had mad.

So much so, when you are working at the edge of your abilities, it's kind of confusing what you have to do more of. If you're having trouble trying to get a piece of software or to ship a product, is something wrong with the code itself? Do you just need to keep building and magically things will fall into place? or is there some magical course you need to do, something that will give you the skills to better tackle this problem> , or is there some fundamental knowledge you are lacking? I feel like this often manifests itself in the question - "should I " . This is also - _are you juist not smart enough?_ I'm sure programmers have asked this themselves the smae quetsion. And of course - the answer is likely NO. You ARE smart and more capable enough and no. But when you're re-reading, it can _really_ be hard to believe that.

I kind of find this. When I first started leetcode, I just felt like there was. I didn't realize the . In this case, you just kind of have to .

I feel like this is also what makes it very hard to make the leap from a beginner to an experienced dev. You have to try both learning and thinking more, and you have to do more.

I do feel like doing a good bit of both whenever you can, . Even if it seems like you might not be increasing, it can be nice.
