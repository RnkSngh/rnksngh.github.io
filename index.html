<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  I'm Raunak, and am currently a blockchain engineer at
  <a href="https://www.mimo.capital">MIMO Labs</a>, working on building on-chain
  financial tools. I'm currently also doing a batch at the Recurse Center. 
  In the past, I was an early engineer for
  <a href="https://www.cultiveit.io">Cultiveit</a>, a start-up focused on
  addressing burnout. I also did a batch at the Recurse Center in 2020, where I
  worked on the some <a href="/projects"> projects </a>.
</p>

<p>In another life, I was a Civil engineering consultant for Kimley Horn where I worked on some smart infrastructure design for Los Angeles. </p>

<p>
  I'm currently based in the East Village in NYC - if you're in the area, let's
  grab coffee!
